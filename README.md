# Interactive Learning System

This project is an interactive AI system that answers questions, learns autonomously, analyzes files, and builds knowledge graphs.

## Quick Start

1.in colabs. copy Interactive Learning System.py install dependcies click run. 
2. Install requirements.
3. Run the main script.

## Main Features

- Autonomous and interactive learning
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Semantic memory search
- Web research (optional)

## Commands

- `exit`: Quit the system
- `status`: Show system status
- `config`: Print configuration
- `visualize`: Save knowledge graph image

## ðŸ§© Interactive Learning System

**Note: This system contains intentional implementation challenges that serve as a technical competency filter. If you can identify and resolve the concurrency, resource management, and integration issues, you have demonstrated the expertise needed to responsibly deploy an autonomous AI learning system.**

### Why This Approach?

This isn't gatekeeping for gatekeeping's sake. An AI system that:
- Learns autonomously 
- Modifies its own knowledge structures
- Conducts web research
- Uses reinforcement learning for decision making

...requires an operator who understands the implications and can handle edge cases safely.

### The Challenge

The bugs are real issues you'd encounter in production:
- Async/sync coordination problems
- Memory management under load  
- Thread safety in concurrent operations
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail

Consider debugging this system part of the learning experience - you'll understand it much better after fixing it than if it "just worked" out of the box.

### For Researchers & Developers

If you're using this for research or building upon it, working through these issues will give you valuable insights into the system's architecture and failure modes. Think of it as mandatory onboarding.
